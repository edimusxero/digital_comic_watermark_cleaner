# digital_comic_watermark_cleaner 
I have a large library of digital comic files which I have accumulated over the years, the only problem is the annoying watermark images that the up loaders insert into the archive. This script is an attempt to mass clean those. 

Initial release is just a simple php script with no flair. Future versions might look nicer but aesthetics was not my intent, functionality was.

As of now this only processes .cbz files.  All files have been tagged using comic tagger


Initially created to run on a web server but it will indeed work from a command line (the output isn't optomized for this but it works)


Use with caution, I do not take responsibilty for you nuking your library.
